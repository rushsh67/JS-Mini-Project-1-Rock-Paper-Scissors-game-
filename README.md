Technologies Used i.e TechStack :
  I have useed Basic HTML-CSS for UI and JavaScript for obtain interactivity and implementing game logic.

Challanges while implementation : 
  1. UI was tricky part as it will change dynamically - Implemented using css grid.
  2. Initially didn't used mobile first aproach so initial UI was only desktop friendly so made it responsive for mobile also.Using Media Queries.
  3.  DOM manipulation not able to make UI change according to requirement so used querySelectors and classlist methods to add/remove class into html             elements.
  4. Maintaining score even after restarting browser made it happen using LocalStorage methods and also made score resetable to 0.

How to Install And Run Projects:
  It is actually pretty simple actually.
  1. Just download project files Zip.
  2. Unzip it and
  3. RUN Index.html Directly into browser.
